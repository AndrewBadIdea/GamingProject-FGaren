name: fgaren members: Robert Ciobanu, 2031544, pvck.v2@gmail.com - Andrew Badea, 2230417, andrewbadea1996@gmail.com Description: we are going to make a roguelike game inspired by the game "Binding of Isaac".
the scenes will consist of similar rooms following a certain theme based on the level. There will be multiple enemies per room. For the second checkpoint we will try to present a room with our main character named "Sion".
For now we didn't decide the name yet.
